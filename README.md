## What is Information Standards for Flight Operations Dataâ€‹

According to http://www.ataebiz.org/Pages/standards.aspx#spec2300:

> â€‹Spec 2300 provides a concise set of information standards and guidelines for the management, configuration and interchange of flight operations technical content, such as System Description, Dispatch Data, Procedures, Limitations, Performance, and Weight and Balance, for fixed-wing and rotorcraft. This Specification uses a modular, data-centric approach for organizing and exchanging information. This approach overcomeâ€‹s the traditional paper-oriented packaging in manuals and allows information to be provided in a format and manner that is more consistent with the way the information is used in the end userâ€™s business processes. This specification is maintained by the Flight Operations Working Group.
